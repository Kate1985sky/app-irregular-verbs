# app-irregular-verbs
A study project for practicing React Router and Bootstrap5.

### About this project

There are 5 pages: a home page, word-of-the-day, all-words, search, create . Also, there is handling 404 errors - not found page.

### Tools and technologies

The stack of the project is: react, react-hooks, react-router-dom, bootstrap.

I've used React's built-in hooks to manage local state and create custom hooks for the convenience of not having to use props.

I've used react-router-dom for the ability to move from page to page without reloading the browser in a single-page application, also i have used hook useNavigate to stay same page without reloading for searching elements, also i have used hook useSearchParams for find it url parameter.


### What I've learned

In the project I've learned what is react-router and how to use it. Created custom hooks.
I've learned new hooks:
1. useNavigate
2. useSearchParams
I've learned how works bootstrap.
I've used and see how works methods startsWith for find it first 3-items.
